# mailchecker
It's a program I needed for myself when I switched from Windows to Ubuntu. Inspired by MailWasher for Windows which does not have Linux version.

Warning: This is a piece of shit code I wrote gradually starting from Gui Test example. I never wrote anything for Gtk or Ubuntu before. Vague documentation on Gtkmm did not particularly help, so I may have done a lot of things improperly. I literally had to guess a lot of things by "try-fail until it works". Mail retrieving and parsing part is also a piece of shit, not parsing MIME as it should, just enough to get what I usually need. It may segfault on some mail formats I did not happen to run into. Many things are hard-coded instead of being configured at run-time as they should. I do not know if it's gonna work with gmail, I only needed it for smtp hosted on my own box. Never tested gmail and I doubt you need it for gmail since gmail has good spam filters. There is no support of multiple mail boxes, I only needed one. And adding support of multiple boxes to this code can not be easy, you should rebuild the whole conception if you want multiple mail boxes. It does not have learning spam filter. It just marks as spam everything that is Chinese which is 90% of spam I receive and checks IPs against SpamCop blacklist. At the end it works even better for me than original MailWasher. But I doubt it will be better for anyone else. 

I know this entire code is an example of how things SHOULD NOT BE DONE. But I did it just for myself and it does what I need. Since there is no alternatives to MailWasher under Ubuntu I'm publishing this code anyway, may be someone else can use it or make something better out of it.

You need to grab executable and vogel.wav and theoretically it should work under Ubuntu. If executable does not, I guess you can grab the source code files and compile it yourself. I used CodeLite for compilation. I used gtkmm-3.0 and curl libs. Curl lib needs to be specified explicitly to the liker.
